This script is mainly for non-acryl hosted instances to get summary report for all ingestion over past 7 days.

It requires DataHub cli 0.13.3.6 or higher and will use the configurations from `~/.datahubenv` to connect to your DataHub instance.

This script will generate an `ingestion_summary.json` file in your local directory which can be shared with Acryl team.
